# Copy as Hyperlink

**Copy as Hyperlink** is a Chrome extension that lets you quickly copy a selected link as a hyperlink, or—if you select non-link text—copy the tab as a hyperlink followed by your selected text. If nothing is selected, it copies the tab’s title and URL as a rich text hyperlink. Perfect for pasting into emails, documents, or any app that supports rich text!
