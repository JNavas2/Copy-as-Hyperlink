Copy as Hyperlink lets you quickly copy any selected link, or—if you select non-link text—copy the current tab as a rich hyperlink followed by your selected text. If nothing is selected, it copies the tab’s title and URL as a rich text hyperlink. Perfect for pasting into emails, documents, or any app that supports rich text. Works seamlessly on both Firefox Desktop and Android.
